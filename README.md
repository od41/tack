# Drops Wallet

Drops wallet is a non-custodial wallet browser extension. The features I implemented are explained in the challenge.

- Non-custodial wallet. Get a seed phrase and sign transactions from your browser.
- Activate a savings feature.
- Use a savings contract that only the user can withdraw from. 
- Save tokens by rounding up transfers, swaps purchases etc. For example, if you swap for $47.83, the wallet rounds it up to $50 and sends the $2.17 difference to your savings.
